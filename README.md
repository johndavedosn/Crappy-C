# Crappy-C
A repo for my crappy C files and projects (They're very crappy)

# Files

Each file or groupe of files in this repo is **representing a project**, Those projects can
be very bad or good or crappy, Thats why this repo is public so anyone can optimize ir, I'm still learning C
so please **Don't laugh at me**.

# sms.c


sms.c is a Student Management System I'm working on as a side projects to learn from it's only, 
some structs and functions thrown togather in the future I'm gonna be adding a CLI control to use it.
